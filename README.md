It should also be responsive and easy to use on various devices. Peer/Teacher review is recommended. You have been provided with assets such as text and images (see link under Resources). You must decide how these will be used in terms of presentation, hierarchy, and design. If any assets are too large, remember to optimize file sizes to ensure smooth loading and a polished user experience. 

You have the choice to work on this individually or as part of a team of two.
