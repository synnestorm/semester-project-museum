                <p class="expo-text">Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we
                    can see and know
                    about
                    the universe around us.</p>
                <p class="expo-text">We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies that can be seen and
                    learn
                    a bit about the early
                    navigators who used the stars to travel by.</p>
                <p class="expo-text">Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early
                    Arab
                    traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the
                    latest exploration of the planets in our solar system.</p>

                <h2 class="expo-heading">Evolution</h2>
                <p class="expo-text">For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our
                    origins. Where do
                    we
                    come from and how did we get here?</p>
                <p class="expo-text">Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a
                    framework
                    for exploring and understanding
                    our place in this world. Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know
                    today
                    have evolved our time.</p>
                <p class="expo-text" id="bio-med">You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t
                    survive,
                    including our Woolly
                    Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.</p>

                <h2 class="expo-heading">Biology and Medicine</h2>
                <p class="expo-text relative">From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are
                    offering
                    us unique
                    insights
                    into the great wonders of the tiny world.</p>
                <p class="expo-text relative">For many people their life expectancy is much longer and
                    their
                    quality of life much improved, thanks to
                    the growth of our understanding of medicine.
                <p class="expo-text relative">Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of
                    medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs
                    including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant. Many of our great medicinal
                    discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing animals
                    in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.</p>

                <p class="expo-text">The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial intelligence are the
                    science of the
                    future.</p>
                <p class="expo-text" id="eco">From useful home applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the
                    future is
                    here. You
                    can

                <h3 class="expo-heading">Ecology</h3>
                <p class="expo-text">As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more
                    important it
                    becomes
                    that scientists explore how to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole
                    planet.</p>
                <p class="expo-text">In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face
                    including global
                    warming,
                    extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all contribute
                    to a
                    brighter future.</p>
