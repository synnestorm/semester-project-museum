                <p class="explore-text">The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can
                    experience the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a
                    lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around us.</p>

                <p class="explore-text">Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early
                    understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring everything from galaxies
                    far away to the very building blocks of life itself.</p>
                <p class="explore-text">We believe science should not be confined to the textbook,
                    but brought to live
                    through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied
                    subjects of science to explore.</p>

                    the middle and windows on the roof." class="center">

                <p class="explore-text">Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play around
                    to see science come to life; apart from the dinosaur exhibits –
                    they only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home..

                    children your age to
                    go on a journey of discovery.

                    Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find out more about the holiday club and how you can

                <p class="explore-text">There are various ways you can support the museum. Donations are very welcome
                    and are an important

                    If you have some
                    item or collection that you think others would enjoy, please let us know by contacting our
                    Collections Department and they will be able to assist you.</p>
                <p class="get-involved-heading">Volunteer</p>
                <p class="explore-text">A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the displays in good
                    order and ready for
                    visitors to come and enjoy. Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the scenes of
                    a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers
                    come together to discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum. You can help
                    volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please contact us if you’d like to find out more about
                    how you can get involved.</p>
                <p class="get-involved-heading">Internships</p>
                <p class="explore-text">Are you interested in working in a museum? Do you enjoy the fun and excitement
                    of sharing the wonders
                    of nature with people? Well you could be just the right person to enjoy an internship at the museum.
                    You’ll be learning from a number of different academics and people who are passionate about science
                    and sharing it with the wider community.</p>
